Inventory summary:

- Total doc files (top-level docs folder): 15+ (excluding subfolders)
- Stories: `docs/stories/` contains multiple story and context files for documentation workflows

Notes:

- Some documentation is workflow-focused (BMM) and may be used to guide the documentation output
- Technical docs and developer setup (e.g., `npcap-setup.md`, `tech-spec.md`) are especially relevant to the documentation workflow
- No separate `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` found (the README and tech-spec include architecture and contribution sections)
